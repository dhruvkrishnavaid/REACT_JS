Displays directory of files and directories stored on disk. In addition to files and directories, DIR also displays both the volume name and amount of free storage space on the disk (if there are files stored in the current directory).

1. Initialize a Repository Locally:
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder where your project is located:
bash

cd /path/to/your/project
Initialize the Git Repository:

Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
bash

git init
This will create a hidden .git folder in your project directory, which stores all the version history and metadata for your project.
Add Files to the Repository:

Add all your project files to the Git repository:
bash

git add .
Commit Your Changes:

After adding files, commit them with a message:
bash

git commit -m "Initial commit"
Connect to a Remote GitHub Repository (Optional):

If you've created a repository on GitHub, you can connect it as a remote:
bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Push Your Changes to GitHub:

Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
bash

git push -u origin main

1. VITE/PARCEL


Vite or parcel kya hai ? wo ek bundler hai , bundler kya krta hai hum bahut saari files mein javascript likhte hai un sabko combine krke humko ek basic file dedeta hai , jisse humara saara kaam hojata hai


React is the core library
iss library ke andar bahut saare concept hai ki aap kis tareeke se hum application bna skte hai and kis tareeke se hum reference hold kr skte hai


1. react-dom(for web)
2. react-native(for mobile app development)
3. three-js(for animations)

How to Start a new React Project

npm (node package manager : package which allows us to install libraries)

npx(node package executer)

create-react-app hai ek utility/software
ye bahut hi bulky utility hai, ye bahut saari cheezein aisi deti hai jo humein chahiye hi nhi , isliye bada bundle size milta hai , packages ka size bhi bahut hota hai

we can setup custom build process in react


react and react-dom do hi main libraries hai

we have also testing libraries for testing through jest

web vitals is used for tracking/record the web applications performance

scripts: ye scripts hi hai jo actual mein projects ko chalati hai ya phir production ke liye ready krti hai

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    to run the projects in development environment

    "build": "react-scripts build",
    jab production mein humari application jati hai toh thoda different behave krti hai..

    React browser ko samjh nhi aata hai , usko khali HTML , CSS , Javascript hi samjh aata hai, 
    wo hum  kis tareeke se generate krte hai wo hum build process se generate krte hai

    "test": "react-scripts test",
    to run all test cases


    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    react se hum application ko reject krlete hai , when we introducing another library or framework , jab humara react ka kam khatam hojata hai

    linting errors and browserlists 
    and development environment
  },
